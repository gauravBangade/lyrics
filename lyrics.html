            Verse 1:

            Have you got color codes lurkin' back in your text?
            And have you ever typed a tag that made your page look the best?
            'Cause there's this feelin' you acquire, that all coders have known
            When you get your divs aligned, it feels like you're at home

            Chorus:

            Do I wanna know, if this tag will close?
            Have you ever tried to make your page design prose?
            Will my layout break? Will it stay in place?
            Have you ever coded late and dreamt of a new interface?
            Maybe we both know, that our code might blow
            But do I wanna know, if this style will show?



            Sure, here's a parody of "Do I Wanna Know?" by Arctic Monkeys called "Do I Wanna Know HTML?":

            Verse 1:
            
            Have you got color codes lurkin' back in your text?
            And have you ever typed a tag that made your page look the best?
            'Cause there's this feelin' you acquire, that all coders have known
            When you get your divs aligned, it feels like you're at home
            
            Chorus:
            
            Do I wanna know, if this tag will close?
            Have you ever tried to make your page design prose?
            Will my layout break? Will it stay in place?
            Have you ever coded late and dreamt of a new interface?
            Maybe we both know, that our code might blow
            But do I wanna know, if this style will show?
            
            Verse 2:
            
            Creepin' back to the editor, you thought youâ€™d fixed it all
            Errors in the console log, your work about to stall
            Now there's a code block somewhere,
            Waiting to cause you grief
            Gettin' my selectors right, still a code relief
            
            Chorus:
            
            Do I wanna know, if this tag will close?
            Have you ever tried to make your page design prose?
            Will my layout break? Will it stay in place?
            Have you ever coded late and dreamt of a new interface?
            Maybe we both know, that our code might blow
            But do I wanna know, if this style will show?

            Bridge:

            (Coders' chant)
            HTML, CSS, JS, we're a mess
            But we carry on and try our best
            Classes, IDs, divs and spans
            Link it up and make it dance
            Outro:

            So do I wanna know...
            Will it break or flow?
            Do I wanna know...
            How to make it glow?
